        text: 'THE SHRINKING EARTH: ECOLOGICAL THREATS\n\n1. In 1977, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and UNESCO jointly published an alarming map of the spread of deserts across the world. Shaded in orange, pink and red were all the areas in danger of desertification. The colored patches covered a major part of the developing world outside the rainy equatorial belt. In Latin America they covered north-east Brazil, central and northern Mexico and stretched right down the Andes as far as Chile. They ate into the Horn of Africa and much of the south-west of the continent. And without interruption they reached half way round the globe in a broad swathe from the Atlantic coast of the Sahara, right across North Africa and the Sahel, through the Middle East and Persia to Pakistan and north-west India.\n\n2. There could be no more graphic expression of the ecological dangers that threaten so much food production, so many livelihoods in the developing countries. The world is losing precious agriculture land at twice the rate that new land is being broken for farming. An area greater than Great Britain is disappearing every year. Soil is being exhausted, eroded, and blown away at the rate of two and a half billion tons per year. By the end of the century, the world may have to support one and a half times its present population on only three-quarters of its present cultivated area.\n\n3. In his report on the state of the environment in 1977, United Nations Environment Programme Director, Mostafa Tolba, warned that, if present trends continue, there would be only 0.15 hectares of farm land per person by the year 2000, half the 1975 level. Productivity would have to double merely to allow people to get the same amount of food as today. These are the figures on which he based that cultivation: in 1975 there were 1240 million hectares under cultivation. Over the next 25 years, perhaps another 300 million new hectares may be opened up but over the same period 600 million hectares- half the entire 1975 cultivated area- may be lost. Of these, half will probably disappear under the ink-bolt spread of cities, which are expanding horizontally twice as fast as the populations are growing, and over some of the best agricultural land. The other 300 million will be the toll of soil degradation.\n\n4. At least half of the total erosion will be in the world\'s 45 million square kilometers of potentially productive but ecologically precarious dry lands, which stretch through a hundred nations. About 700 million people live in this zone, almost all of them in developing countries, and 18 million live in areas that are currently undergoing rapid desertification.\n\n5. Everywhere the deserts are advancing. In Sudan, the southern edge of the Sahara moved south by 100 kms between 1958 and 1975. The deserts do not march forward on a solid front, like an army. Patches appear, like those at Aorema in Burkina Faso, around centers of population or watering holes, then spread, link up with others, and finally merge into the desert itself.\n\n6. The chief agent of what has been called leprosy of the soil is man, the impact of his activities on highly sensitive and delicately balanced ecosystem. The prime factor in the process is population increase. The number of people in the Sahel, for example is doubling every 25 to 30 years. We can see everywhere the consequences of this among settled farmers: the cutting down of fallow periods, progressive decline in the vegetation cover, increasing erosion. As population goes on growing, cultivation is pushed into areas that are entirely unsuitable for agriculture, and there the process progresses even more rapidly.',

        text: 'PASSAGE II\nUNITED NATIONS- Nearly 60 million people have been driven from their homes by war and persecution, an unprecedented global exodus that has burdened fragile counties with waves of new comers and littered deserts and seas with the bodies of those who died trying to reach safety. The new figures, released recently by the United Nations refugee agency, paint a staggering picture of a world where new conflicts are erupting and old ones are refusing to subside, driving up the total number of displaced people to a record 59.5 million by the end of 2014, the most recent year tailed.\n\nHalf of the displaced are children. Nearly 14 million people were newly displaced in 2014, according to the annual report by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. in other words, tens of thousands of people were forced to leave their homes every day and "seek protection elsewhere" last year, the report found. Tens of millions of others fled in previous years and remain stuck, sometimes for decades, unable to go home or find a permanent new one, according to the refugee agency. They include the more than 2.5 million displaced in the Darfur region of Sudan, and the 1.5 million Afghans still living in Pakistan.\n\nWhen refugees flee their own countries, most of them wind up in the world\'s less-developed nations, with Turkey, Iran and Pakistan hosting the largest numbers. One in four refugees now finds shelter in the world\'s poorest countries, with Ethiopia and Kenya taking many more refugees than, say, Britain and France. As the report states, "the global distribution of refugees remains heavily skewed away from wealthier nations and towards the less wealthy." Even so, there has been a sharp backlash in European capitals against the waves of people coming across the Mediterranean Sea, including many who are fleeing conflict and repression in countries like Syria and Eritrea. For now, the European Union has shelved its plans to get approval from the lawless Libya and to destroy the ships they use to bring migrants across the sea. Instead, the European Union is scheduled to meet on Monday to discuss whether it will start military operations in the international waters of the Mediterranean Sea, for which it does not need the Council\'s blessings.\n\nEuropean Union leaders are still squabbling with one another over how to spilt up at least 40,000 asylum seekers across their 28 member states. And they have stepped up search and rescue operations after intense public pressure stemming from a sharp increase in the deaths of migrants crossing the Mediterranean this year. Australia has felt no such compunction. Its prime minster, Tony Abbot, has pledged to turn around migrant boats before they enter Australian territorial waters, including those with minority Rohingyas fleeing persecution in Myanmar. His administration faces scrutiny over allegations that it paid smugglers to turn a boat back to Indonesia after it was intercepted on the high seas.\n\n"For an age of unprecedented mass displacement, we need an unprecedented humanitarian response and a renewed global commitment to tolerance and protection for people fleeing conflict and persecution," Antonio Guterres, the high commissioner for refugees, said in a statement accompanying the annual report.\n\nAmnesty International, in a report issued this week, accused governments and smugglers alike of pursuing "selfish political interest instead of showing roughly 70,00 refugees each year, though its plans to admit 2,000 Syrian refugees this year have drawn scrutiny from Republican lawmakers who worry that some among them might be terrorists. The war in Syria is the largest source of displacement. By the end of 2014, 7.6 million Syrians ere displaced within the country itself, and nearly another 3.9 million were refugees living outside the war-torn nation.\n\nSource: United Nations English Language Programme',
